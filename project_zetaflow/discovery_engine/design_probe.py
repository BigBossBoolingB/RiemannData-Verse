# Requirements:
# pip install jax jaxlib flax optax numpy
# (Assumes previous phase models are available or dummy versions are used)
#
# Important Considerations:
# 1. Loading Previous Models: The script uses placeholders for loading trained models
#	from Phase 2 and 3. A robust checkpointing/loading mechanism (e.g., using
#	`flax.training.checkpoints`) is needed.
# 2. ProbeNet Architecture: The architecture of `ProbeNet` is crucial.
#	How (and if) features from the Phase 2 Transformer inform this architecture
#	(e.g., number of layers, hidden sizes, specific initializations) is a key design choice.
# 3. Objective Function Integral: The integral in `probe_objective_loss` is approximated
#	by a simple mean over points on the critical line. More sophisticated numerical
#	integration methods (e.g., Gaussian quadrature, adaptive Simpson) might be needed
#	for accuracy, especially if the integrand is highly oscillatory. The range of
#	integration (INTEGRATION_T_MIN, INTEGRATION_T_MAX) also matters.
# 4. Conjecture Extraction: Translating a trained neural network (ProbeNet) into a
#	"clean, symbolic mathematical formula" is generally very difficult. The output
#	is more likely to be the network's learned weights and a set of *observed properties*
#	or behaviors of M(s) and M(s)Zeta(s). These observations would then form the basis
#	for a human-formulated conjecture. Techniques like symbolic regression or model distillation
#	might be explored but are advanced research topics.
# 5. Stability and Constraints: The optimization process for ProbeNet might need
#	constraints or regularizations to ensure M(s) is "well-behaved" (e.g., smooth, bounded,
#	analytic in certain regions if that's desired for a mollifier).
