# Project ZetaFlow

Project ZetaFlow is a multi-phase, interdisciplinary research platform aimed at solving the Riemann Hypothesis. This project reframes the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) not as a static problem, but as a dynamic one concerning information stability and complexity.

The project is divided into five phases:

1.  **Data Verse (`data_verse/`)**: Focuses on creating a comprehensive, high-precision database of Riemann zeta function zeros.
2.  **Signal Analysis (`signal_analysis/`)**: Aims to develop a deep learning model to learn the "grammar" of the zero sequence.
3.  **System Modeling (`system_modeling/`)**: Involves creating a differentiable software surrogate for the Riemann zeta function.
4.  **Discovery Engine (`discovery_engine/`)**: Designed to automate the design of an optimal "analytic probe" (mollifier) to generate testable conjectures.
5.  **Verification Engine (`verification_engine/`)**: Provides a framework for a human-AI team to construct formal, machine-checkable proofs of the generated conjectures.

This repository contains the foundational code scaffolding for each of these phases. Each phase has its own subdirectory with specific code, configurations, and documentation.

Refer to the `README.md` file within each phase's subdirectory for more detailed information about that specific component of Project ZetaFlow.

## Core Philosophy

The central idea is that the arrangement of the Riemann zeta function's non-trivial zeros on the critical line represents a state of minimal complexity or a "ground state". Our approach is not to find a single "silver bullet" proof but to build a robust, iterative pipeline that uses machine learning to discover deep patterns, generate precise mathematical conjectures, and then use formal methods to verify them.
