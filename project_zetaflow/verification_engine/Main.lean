Conjecture ZetaFlow_Probe_Conjecture_1 :
  Let M_s be a function from ℂ to ℂ with the following properties:
  (P1) M_s is analytic in the strip {s : ℂ | 0 < s.re < 1}.
  (P2) M_s satisfies certain growth conditions: |M_s (σ + i*t)| < ... for large |t|.
  (P3) M_s has a specific structure or formula derived from ProbeNet (this is the hardest part to formalize).

  Then, for s such that s.re = 1/2 and s.im > T0 (for some T0 > 0):
    abs (1 - M_s * complex.zeta s) < ε -- for some small ε > 0
  Or, alternatively:
    Integral (abs (1 - M_s * complex.zeta s))^2 ds along the critical line converges and is small.

  And this, combined with properties P1, P2, P3, implies the Riemann Hypothesis.

-- Workflow for Human-AI Hybrid Formal Proof Development:

-- Step 1: Human mathematician formalizes the conjecture from Phase 4.
-- This involves:
--   a. Defining all mathematical objects precisely (e.g., the probe function M(s), its domain, its properties).
--   b. Stating the core assertion (e.g., an inequality, a property of an integral).
--   c. Stating the implication (i.e., that this conjecture implies the Riemann Hypothesis,
--	  which itself needs to be formally stated or imported from Mathlib).
-- This step is critical and requires deep mathematical understanding.

-- Example: Formalizing the Riemann Hypothesis (if not already in Mathlib in the desired form)
/-
def RiemannHypothesis : Prop :=
  ∀ (s : ℂ), complex.zeta s = 0 → s.re = 1/2 ∨ (s.re < 0 ∧ s.im = 0) -- Simplified, ignoring trivial zeros for now
-/

-- Step 2: At a given proof state (goal) in Lean, query an AI Assistant like Llemma.
-- The human mathematician identifies a specific subgoal they are working on.
-- The current proof state (hypotheses and target goal) is formatted and sent to Llemma's API.
-- Example (conceptual API interaction, not actual code):
--   `llemma_api.query(current_goal_state_string)`
--   This might involve a custom tool or VS Code extension that interfaces with Llemma.

-- Step 3: Human evaluates the suggested tactics from Llemma.
-- Llemma might suggest:
--   - Relevant theorems from Mathlib (e.g., "try applying `cauchy_schwarz_inequality`").
--   - Specific Lean tactics (e.g., "use `rw [...]` or `simp only [...]`").
--   - High-level proof ideas ("consider splitting into cases based on...").
--
-- CRITICAL: Llemma is a tool for exploration and suggestion, NOT an oracle.
-- Human expertise is essential to:
--   - Validate the relevance and correctness of suggestions.
--   - Be aware of known LLM failure modes:
--	 * Hallucination: Suggesting non-existent theorems or incorrect facts.
--	 * Logic Violations: Proposing steps that are not logically sound.
--	 * Hidden Assumptions: Using unstated or incorrect assumptions.
--	 * Misinterpretation: Misunderstanding the nuance of the mathematical goal.
--   - Adapt suggestions to the specific context of the proof.

-- Step 4: Apply a valid tactic in Lean.
-- The human mathematician chooses a promising tactic (either from Llemma or their own insight)
-- and applies it in the Lean proof editor (e.g., VS Code with Lean 4 extension).
-- The Lean kernel provides 100% verification of each step. If a tactic is invalid or
-- does not achieve the claimed result, Lean will report an error. This ensures rigor.
-- Example:
/-
theorem example_lemma (x y : ℝ) (h : x < y) : x + 1 < y + 1 := by
  -- Llemma might suggest `add_lt_add_right` or simply `linarith`
  linarith -- Lean kernel verifies this step
-/

-- Step 5 (Feedback Loop): If the main conjecture (or a key lemma) proves unprovable
-- with current strategies, the specific failing point provides diagnostic data.
--   - Which lemma could not be proven?
--   - What specific mathematical obstacle was encountered?
-- This diagnostic information is fed back to Phase 4 (Discovery Engine).
-- The team might then:
--   - Refine the architecture or training of ProbeNet.
--   - Adjust the objective function for ProbeNet optimization.
--   - Seek a slightly different (potentially more tractable) probe function M(s).
-- This iterative process of discovery, conjecture, formalization, and verification (with feedback)
-- is central to Project ZetaFlow's methodology.

  IO.println "This Lean project is intended for formalizing and proving conjectures."
  IO.println "Please refer to the README.md and comments for workflow details."
  IO.println "Main conjecture to be formalized: (see comments above)"
  -- Example of how you might print a formalized statement if defined:

-- Placeholder for actual proof development
-- theorem MyConjectureImpliesRH (h_conj : ZetaFlow_Probe_Conjecture_1) : RiemannHypothesis := by
  -- Proof would start here
  -- sorry -- Lean's way of saying "proof omitted for now"

-- theorem prove_main_conjecture : ZetaFlow_Probe_Conjecture_1 := by
  -- This is the ultimate goal for this phase: to prove the main conjecture generated
  -- (and then formalized) from Phase 4.
  -- This will involve many lemmas, theories, and potentially new mathematics.
