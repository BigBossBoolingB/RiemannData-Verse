Overview
Project ZetaFlow is an ambitious, multi-disciplinary research initiative designed to tackle the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) by leveraging a novel synthesis of modern software engineering, deep learning, and formal proof verification.[1, 2] For over 160 years, the RH has stood as one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, with deep implications for number theory, cryptography, and physics.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
This project moves beyond traditional, siloed approaches. Instead of searching for a single static formula or object, ZetaFlow reframes the RH as a problem of information dynamics. We posit that the truth of the RH arises from a fundamental principle of stability and minimal complexity in the relationship between the primes and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
Our strategy is to build a five-phase software pipeline that can learn the deep structure of the zeta function's zeros, design intelligent "probes" to test its properties, and translate computational discoveries into formally verified mathematical proofs.
The Core Idea: From Static Objects to Information Dynamics
Traditional approaches have focused on finding a single key—a specific operator, a geometric space, or a definitive inequality. ZetaFlow is built on a different philosophy:
> The Riemann Hypothesis is not a statement about a static object, but a consequence of the universe of numbers settling into a state of maximal stability and coherence. An off-critical-line zero would represent a state of higher "energy" or complexity that is not permitted by the fundamental structure of arithmetic.
> 
This project treats the distribution of prime numbers as a "signal" and the oscillating error term, governed by the zeta zeros, as structured "noise". Our goal is not to cancel this noise, but to use advanced computational techniques to prove that its structure is as perfect and well-behaved as the Riemann Hypothesis predicts.
Project Architecture: The 5-Phase Pipeline
ZetaFlow is structured as a sequential pipeline where the output of each phase serves as the input for the next, creating a cycle of computational discovery and formal verification.
Phase 1: The Riemann Data-Verse (Data Foundation)
This phase focuses on creating the world's most comprehensive, high-precision, and accessible database of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and related L-functions. This dataset is the empirical ground truth for all subsequent machine learning models.
 * Goal: Consolidate and extend existing datasets (from Odlyzko, ZetaGrid, LMFDB) into a unified, queryable database.
 * Methodology: Implement and scale the Odlyzko-Schönhage algorithm for rapid, high-precision zero computation.[11, 12] The system will be designed for parallel processing to continuously expand the database.[13]
 * Tech Stack:
   * Computation: C++, Python
   * High-Precision Arithmetic: mpmath, GNU MPFR, GMP
   * Database: ClickHouse or QuestDB (optimized for massive time-series data)
   * Interface: Web API for public access and data download.
Phase 2: Signal Analysis (Generative Zero Model)
Here, we move beyond simple statistical tests (like the Montgomery-Odlyzko law) to learn the deep, underlying "grammar" of the zero sequence.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18] The goal is to capture the subtle arithmetic signal hidden within the GUE-like statistical noise.
 * Goal: Train a generative model that understands the higher-order correlations (n-point functions) of the zero sequence.[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]
 * Methodology: Treat the sequence of normalized zeros as a mathematical language. Train a Transformer model to predict the location of the next zero based on a long history, forcing it to learn the sequence's fundamental patterns.
 * Tech Stack:
   * Frameworks: PyTorch, JAX
   * Architecture: Transformer models, which are state-of-the-art for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data.[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]
Phase 3: System Modeling (Differentiable Zeta Surrogate)
To design a probe, we need a working model of the system to be probed. This phase creates a high-fidelity, differentiable software surrogate for the zeta function itself.
 * Goal: Develop a neural network that approximates \\zeta(s) in the critical strip while respecting its core mathematical properties.
 * Methodology: Use a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The network's loss function will be constrained by the Riemann functional equation, forcing the model to learn the function's fundamental symmetry. Recent advances allow PINNs to handle complex-valued functions effectively.
 * Tech Stack:
   * Frameworks: JAX, PyTorch, MATLAB
   * Architecture: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
Phase 4: The Discovery Engine (Automated Probe Design)
This is the active discovery phase. We automate the design of an optimal "analytic probe"—a next-generation mollifier—to test the properties of our zeta function model.
 * Goal: Computationally derive a function that, when paired with the zeta function, simplifies it in a way that makes the Riemann Hypothesis transparent.
 * Methodology: Frame the task as a scientific discovery inverse problem. A probe function, parameterized as a neural network, is initialized using the statistical knowledge from the Transformer (Phase 2). This probe is then optimized via gradient descent against the PINN-based zeta surrogate (Phase 3) to find a function that minimizes a target objective (e.g., variance on the critical line).
 * Output: An explicit mathematical formula for the probe and a concrete, testable conjecture (e.g., "This function, when integrated against \\zeta(s), is bounded by X, which implies RH").
Phase 5: The Verification Engine (Hybrid Formal Proof)
A computational result is not a mathematical proof. This final phase translates the machine-generated conjecture into the language of absolute logical rigor, addressing the known failure modes of LLMs in mathematics by keeping a human in the loop.[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]
 * Goal: Construct a formal, machine-checkable proof of the conjecture generated in Phase 4.
 * Methodology: A hybrid human-AI team uses a formal proof assistant. A human mathematician provides the high-level strategy and insight, while a specialized mathematical LLM suggests tactics, finds relevant theorems in existing libraries, and automates tedious steps. Every single line of the proof is formally verified by the proof assistant's kernel, ensuring total correctness.
 * Tech Stack:
   * Proof Assistant: Lean (and its extensive mathlib library).[42, 43, 44, 45]
   * AI Assistant: Llemma, an open-source LLM specifically trained on mathematical texts and formal proofs.[46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]
 * The Feedback Loop: If a proof attempt fails, the formal system identifies the exact point of failure. This diagnostic information is fed back to Phase 4 to refine the probe and generate a new, stronger conjecture. This creates an iterative cycle of discovery and verification.
